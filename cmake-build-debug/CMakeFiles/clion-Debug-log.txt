CMake Warning (dev) at /opt/clion-2022.3.1/bin/cmake/linux/share/cmake-3.24/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args`
  (PCL_OUTOFCORE) does not match the name of the calling package (PCL).  This
  can lead to problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result
  variables (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
